    <h3>Note: These cards have been obtained from various sources, and some may be of low quality. Additionally, some cards may have 
        been modified before I acquired them. During processing, I have added a â–³R symbol next to the Hasbro logo to clearly identify 
        these cards as reproductions. This measure helps prevent these cards from being produced and sold as originals. I am seeking 
        high-quality scans at 600 DPI or above. I would greatly appreciate anyone who is willing to scan and share high-quality images 
        of their cards. Please refer to this 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1krZZ8-Vqw29URCuTV1TqgFdFICMtGWUQPmpFTLoKcZE/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheet</a> 
        to see which card scans are still needed. You can contact me through the 
        <a href="https://github.com/abnoba12/HeroscapeIndexCardBuilder/discussions">discussion board on GitHub</a>
